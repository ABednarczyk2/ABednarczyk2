1) create excel table from aggregated values of mps orth and fedfunds 
APPENDIX

   # 1 MPS by year (biennial format)
   mps_biennial_sum <- monetary_policy_surprises_data %>%
     group_by(Year) %>%
     summarise(MPS_ORTH_sum_clean = sum(MPS_ORTH, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
     rename(year = Year)
   
   # 2  FedFunds by year (average)
   fedfunds_annual_clean <- FEDFUNDS %>%
     mutate(year = year(as.Date(observation_date))) %>%
     group_by(year) %>%
     summarise(FEDFUNDS_avg_clean = mean(FEDFUNDS, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
     arrange(year)
   
   # 3 biennial FedFunds changes (level and percent)
   fedfunds_biennial_change <- fedfunds_annual_clean %>%
     mutate(
       FEDFUNDS_change_biennial_clean = FEDFUNDS_avg_clean - lag(FEDFUNDS_avg_clean, 2),
       FEDFUNDS_pct_change_biennial_clean = (FEDFUNDS_avg_clean / lag(FEDFUNDS_avg_clean, 2) - 1) * 100 # didint really use this garbage but i was trying to recreate the skibidi process i used before to the t not to f up 
     ) %>%
     filter(year %in% seq(1999, 2021, by = 2))
   
   # 4 FedFunds with MPS data merge
   iv_dataset_clean <- fedfunds_biennial_change %>%
     left_join(mps_biennial_sum, by = "year")
   
   # main panel merge
   d7tr <- d7tr %>%
     left_join(iv_dataset_clean, by = "year") %>%
     filter(year %in% 1999:2021)  # Keep valid biennial years

this way its making sure then run the regression on that somehow 

also without aggregation at all

2)
